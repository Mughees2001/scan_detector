TODO:
change MAC on all nodes (random would be good)

Fix run for: dnsenum (both), skipfish (both), ike-scan (129)

Run with tools against open ports (specific versions)
Run with additional tools (all with rules)
Auto-generate suricata rules
Multi-packet indicators (e.g., a DNS request and then scan - wpscan)

Look for non-content-based sigs (may be hard)

Truly parallel runs

Paper:
tools that scan usually need to fill in some details and usually they don't go to the trouble of reimplementing the entire protocol; or even close to that. They end up using canned values -- this is what we are targetting = the additional effort it would require to look like a real client device.
